# SGPA-Calculator
"SEMESTER GRADE POINT AVERAGE" Calculator which uses only simple python functions and modules like 'time'.
There are only two defined functions.
It is very simple to understand.
I have used HTML,CSS,JSX,etc., for responsive web application.
Here u need to convert 100 to 10 for grade 'A',90 to 9 for grade 'B', and so on......
